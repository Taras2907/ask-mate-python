Error reporting as well as debug info recovers data from so-called pdb files, which are program database. These files store meta information about your program code, including original file names, locations and source code line numbers. The amount of information stored is controllable and usually depends on your build type (Debug, Release). These files are being distributed together with your binaries and whichever system is used as a host, whenever it needs meta information (like call stack), it takes it from them.",
